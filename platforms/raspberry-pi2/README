This README is only to run the prepare-image.sh script from the fletch repository.
To do so you have to build the fletch-vm and fletch-agent.snapshot file manually
and copy them to the 'data' directory before running the scripts.

To do this type:

fletch-vm:

$ cd <dir of fletch directory in fletch repository>
$ ninja -C out/DebugXARM
$ cp out/DebugXARM/fletch-vm platforms/raspberry-pi2/data

fletch-agent.snapshot (requires a fletch build):

$ ./out/ReleaseIA32/fletch export pkg/fletch_agent/bin/agent.dart to file platforms/raspberry-pi2/data/fletch-agent.snapshot
