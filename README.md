# The Dartino project

The Dartino project aims to make developers more productive at writing
application code for embedded devices. It is powered by the [Dart
language](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch02.html) and a
fast, lean runtime.

Dartino is currently in an alpha state, and still incomplete. We'd be very happy
to hear about things that work well and areas that need more work (see feedback
below).

## Trying it out

To try out Dartino for embedded device development, please see the
[Dartino site](https://dartino.org).
