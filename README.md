# The Dartino project

Dartino is an **experimental** project to enable highly productive development
for devices. It is powered by the [Dart language](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch02.html)
and a fast, lean runtime.

Dartino is very much incomplete. We'd be very happy to hear about things that
work well and areas that need more work (see feedback below). Also note that
in the current state this is shared to enable experimentation and feedback,
so don't expect to be able to build complete products on top of it.

## Trying it out

To try out Dartino for embedded device development, please see the
[Dartino site](https://dartino.org).
