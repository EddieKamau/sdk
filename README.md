# The Fletch project

Fletch is an **experimental** project to enable highly productive development
for devices. It is powered by the [Dart language](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch02.html)
and a fast, lean runtime.

Fletch is very much incomplete. We'd be very happy to hear about things that
work well and areas that need more work (see feedback below). Also note that
in the current state this is shared to enable experimentation and feedback,
so don't expect to be able to build complete products on top of it.

## Trying it out

To try out Fletch for embedded device development, please see the
[Fletch site](http://dart-lang.github.io/fletch/).

For details on Fletch Services for Android or iOS, please see the [Fletch Services wiki page](https://github.com/dart-lang/fletch/wiki/Dart-Services-IDL).
