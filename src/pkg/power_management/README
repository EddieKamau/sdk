This is a native extension used by the power management package (in
pkg/power_management) to get access to power management support the
platform specific C API. When making changes to this code the native
extension need to be updated namually in the package.

When testing changes on Mac OS:

$ ninja -C out/ReleaseX64
$ src/pkg/mdns/copy_dylib.sh

When the new .dylib file is working upload it to GCS

$ src/pkg/mdns/upload_dylib.sh

The resulting .sha1 file (in pkg/power management/lib/native) is then
updated and checked in.

On Linux replace _dylib with _so in the two script names.
