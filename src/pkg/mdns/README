This is a native extension used by the mDNS package (in pkg/mdns) to
get mDNS support on Mac OS using the C API. When making changes to
this code the native extension need to be updated namually in the
package.

When testing changes on Mac OS:

$ ninja -C out/ReleaseX64
$ src/pkg/mdns/copy_dylib.sh

When the new .dylib file is working upload it to GCS

$ src/pkg/mdns/upload_dylib.sh

The resulting .sha1 file (in pkg/mdns/lib/native) is then updated and
checked in.

On Linux replace _dylib with _so in the two script names.

The extension is also implemented for Linux, but in a no-operation
mode with just simple echo testing. The reason for this is that the
mDNS package can then always load the dynamic library.
