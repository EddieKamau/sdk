# Fletch uses the same schema as the normal dart sdk for making releases.
# We currently don't do any stable releases, but we still utilize the same
# structure while working our way towards the first 0.1 stable release.
#
# This also means that we follow the same procedure as can be found here:
# https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/wiki/Branches-and-releases
# for doing dev releases

# The numbers are changed as follows:
#
#  * New release cycle has begun (i.e. stable release was just made):
#     - increase MINOR by 1
#     - set "PATCH 0"
#     - set "PRERELEASE 0"
#     - set "PRERELEASE_PATCH 0"
#
#  * Doing a push-to-trunk from master:
#    (The first push-to-trunk in the release cycle will set PRERELEASE to 0)
#     - increase PRERELEASE by 1
#     - set "PRERELEASE_PATCH 0"
#
#  * Doing a cherry-pick to trunk:
#     - increase PRERELEASE_PATCH by 1
#
#  * Making a stable release (i.e. new stable branch):
#     - set "PRERELEASE 0"
#     - set "PRERELEASE_PATCH 0"
#    The new stable release version will sort higher than the prereleases.
#
#  * Making cherry-picks to stable channel
#     - increase PATCH by 1
#
