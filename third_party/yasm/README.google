Description:
Glue scripts to use yasm to compile assembly files. The sources for yasm are
downloaded separately and have a different license (see README.chromium).

Local Modifications:
We only use the gyp glue and windows configuration files in

third_party/yasm/source/config/win/*

third_party/yasm/yasm.gyp
third_party/yasm/yasm_compile.gypi
third_party/yasm/README.chromium

Modified to fit the fletch build system and to only operate on windows.
