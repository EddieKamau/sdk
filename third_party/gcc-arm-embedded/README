This directory contains the pre-built GNU toolchain from ARM Cortex-M &
Cortex-R processors (Cortex-M0/M0+/M3/M4/M7, Cortex-R4/R5/R7).

This is from https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded.

To update to a new version do the following:

1. Download the version and unpack it.

2. Create a copy in a directory called gcc-arm-embedded, copying
   following symlinks (and hardlinks, but that is default), e.g.:

   $ cp -RL gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q3 gcc-arm-embedded

3. Add an approiate README.google file (start with the one
   in the previous version and update it).

4. Tar and upload to Google Cloud Storage

   $ tar caf gcc-arm-embedded.tar.gz gcc-arm-embedded
   $ upload_to_google_storage.py \
       -b dartino-dependencies gcc-arm-embedded.tar.gz

5. Create a CL updating the .sha1 files.
