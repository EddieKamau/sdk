This directory is a split repo overlay for the LK kernel found at

https://github.com/travisg/lk

that contains the fletch specific parts to build a fletch vm that can run as
an app within the LK kernel. To build, you need to checkout the LK sources
to lk-downstream, e.g.

git checkout https://github.com/travisg/lk.git lk-downstream

Next, run 

make

to build the default target for qemu emulation or, e.g.,

make PROJECT=stm32746g-fletch

to build for the stm32746g evaluation board.
