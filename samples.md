# Fletch project samples

We have a number of sample programs available in the ```/samples/``` folder.
Letâ€™s take a look at the code, and get familiar with the platform.


* [The 'hello world' of embedded: Blink an LED](#blinky)
* [Controlling GPIO input and output pins](#buzzer)
* [Using GPIO events](#door-bell)
* [Structuring larger programs with classes](#knight-rider)

## Blinky ##

Embedded devices are most commonly used to collect data and perform some kind of
control task via attached sensors and output devices such as LEDs. Take a look
at the ```blinky.dart``` program located in the ```/samples/basic/``` folder.
This blinks the Raspberry Pi on-board LED.

First the program initializes the RaspberryPi helper object:

~~~
RaspberryPi pi = new RaspberryPi();
pi.leds.activityLED.setMode(OnboardLEDMode.gpio);
~~~

Next, it simply loops and alternates between turning the led on and off:

~~~
while (true) {
  pi.leds.activityLED.on();
  sleep(500);
  pi.leds.activityLED.off();
  sleep(500);
}
~~~

Pretty easy, right!?

## Buzzer

Let's expand on the previous sample by wiring up a small custom circuit. We will
use a [breadboard](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-use-a-breadboard/) for
fast iteration.

Start by building a circuit resembling [this schematic](https://storage.googleapis.com/fletch-archive/images/buzzer-schematic.png).

We will be communicating with the components on the breadboard using a
[GPIO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_input/output) (general
purpose input/output) interface. First we need to configure the GPIO pins for
the components we wired up (full runnable code located in
```/samples/basic/buzzer.dart```):

~~~
import 'package:gpio/gpio.dart';

main() {
  // GPIO pin constants.
  const int button = 16;
  const int speaker = 21;
~~~

Notice how we are using pins 16 and 21. Those pin numbers are based on the
connection points shown in the schematic, and the [pinout for the Raspberry Pi
2](http://www.raspberry-projects.com/pi/pi-hardware/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/rpi2-model-b-io-pins).

Next, we need to tell GPIO which pins we intend to write to (i.e., use as
output), and which we intend to read from (i.e., use as input):

~~~
RaspberryPi pi = new RaspberryPi();
PiMemoryMappedGPIO gpio = pi.memoryMappedGPIO;
gpio.setMode(button, Mode.input);
gpio.setMode(speaker, Mode.output);
~~~

Finally, we simply spin in an internal loop and map the state of the button to
the speaker, i.e. when we see a high signal on the button we set a high signal
on the speaker and vice versa.

~~~
while (true) {
  bool buttonState = gpio.getPin(button);
  gpio.setPin(speaker, buttonState);
}
~~~

## Door bell

In the buzzer sample we spun in an eternal loop to sound out speaker. Often it
can be more convenient to wait for a certain state to occur. This is supported
via GPIO events. Let try to build a small door bell.

First we need to configure GPIO for events. We configure the pins as before, and
then enable a trigger on the button:

~~~
// Initialize Raspberry Pi and configure the pins.
RaspberryPi pi = new RaspberryPi();
SysfsGPIO gpio = pi.sysfsGPIO;

// Initialize pins.
gpio.exportPin(speaker);
gpio.setMode(speaker, Mode.output);
gpio.exportPin(button);
gpio.setMode(button, Mode.input);
gpio.setTrigger(button, Trigger.both);
~~~

Next, we simply wait for the button to be pressed (i.e., for the GPIO pin of the
button to go to 'true'):

~~~
while (true) {
  // Wait for button press.
  gpio.waitFor(button, true, -1);

  ....
  }
}
~~~

And then we sound the bell:

~~~
// Sound bell
for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  gpio.setPin(speaker, true);
  sleep(100);
  gpio.setPin(speaker, false);
  sleep(500);
}
~~~

## Knight rider

In all the previous samples we relied on a very simple program structure: A few
lines of initialization code, and then a small eternal loop in which we had a
few more lines of code. For our next sample we are going to explore a slightly
larger program to illustrate how the Dart programming language allows us to
structure our program using classes and encapsulation.

We are going to build a small running light. Remember
[KITT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo8Qls0HnWo), the car from the Knight
Rider show? Let's try to [replicate those
lights](https://storage.googleapis.com/fletch-archive/images/knight-rider.mp4).

The full program is available in ```/samples/basic/knight-rider.dart```. Let's
step through how it's built.

First we will create a ```Lights``` helper class. This class will contain all
the core functionality required for managing the LEDs on the breadboard that we
will be animating. Initially let's define a variable containing a list of
integers containing the GPIO pins of all the connected LEDs, and a variable
containing a GPIO manager. Note that the GPIO variable starts with an
underscore; this is the Dart syntax for declaring a private variable that is
encapsulated to the implementation of the class.)

~~~
class Lights {
  final GPIO _gpio;
  final List<int> leds;

  Lights(this._gpio, this.leds);
  ...
}
~~~

Next, let's implement a small helper function that we can call with a LED number
(e.g., 2), and which then turns LED number 2 in the LED chain on and turns all
the other LEDs in the chain off:

~~~
// Sets LED [ledToEnable] to true, and all others to false.
void _setLeds(int ledToEnable) {
  var state;

  for (int i = 0; i < leds.length; i++) {
    bool state = (i == ledToEnable);
    _gpio.setPin(leds[i], state);
  }
}
~~~

Next, we need to have the lights first move from the left to the right, and then
from the right to the left. We will do this in another two methods that simply
run in a for loop either from 0 to the number or LEDs, or the opposite, and then
call the helper function above:

~~~
// Iterates though the lights in increasing order, and sets the LEDs using
// a helper function. Pauses [waitTime] milliseconds before returning.
void runLightLeft(int waitTime) {
  for (int counter = 0; counter < leds.length; counter++) {
    _setLeds(counter);
    sleep(waitTime);
  }
}

// Iterates though the lights in decreasing order, and sets the LEDs using
// a helper function. Pauses [waitTime] milliseconds before returning.
void runLightRight(int waitTime) {
  for (int counter = leds.length - 1; counter >= 0; counter--) {
    _setLeds(counter);
    sleep(waitTime);
  }
}
~~~

Finally, we just need a small Main function to to hold the GPIO pins, to
initialize our Lights helper class, and to call the lights methods, and we are
done!

~~~
main() {
  // Initialize Raspberry Pi
  RaspberryPi pi = new RaspberryPi();

  // Array constant containing the GPIO pins of the connected LEDs.
  // You can add more LEDs simply by extending the list. Make sure
  // the pins are listed in the order the LEDs are connected.
  List<int> leds = [26, 19, 13, 6];

  // Initialize the lights controller class.
  Lights lights = new Lights(pi.memoryMappedGPIO, leds);
  lights.init();

  // Alternate between running left and right in a continuous loop.
  const int waitTime = 100;
  while (true) {
    lights.runLightLeft(waitTime);
    lights.runLightRight(waitTime);
  }
}
~~~
